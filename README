This package provides PyPy bindings for the Bullet physics library using cppyy.

=== COMPATIBILITY ===

As cppyy is currently only implemented for PyPy, you will need to use PyPy (not
CPython) to use these bindings.

Theoretically, the PyROOT package (which cppyy is based on) supports CPython,
and it may be possible to use these source files to build or use equivalent
Bullet bindings for CPython using PyROOT, but this has not been tested and I do
not personally know exactly what would be required to do this.  (If anybody
wants to give this a try, please let me know how it goes!)

This package has currently only been tested under Ubuntu Linux.  I believe it
should work equivalently under most other Unix-like OSes (including MacOS X,
though some paths may need tweaking when building, I'm not sure).  It should
theoretically also work with only minor changes under Windows as well, but I
haven't really looked into this at all yet.

=== STATUS ===

This package is currently in a very preliminary state.  Basic bindings exist
for most of the Bullet classes and functions, and simple apps can be built.
Very little testing has been done yet.

The largest issue right now is probably the lack of callback support (due to
limitations in Reflex, which cppyy is currently based on), which is likely to
be needed by most non-trivial applications.  In the long term, it should be
possible to fix this when cppyy moves to a Cling (LLVM) backend, but that is
still a work-in-progress.  In the meantime, I have a plan for an interim
workaround, and will hopefully have something better in place soon.

The current plan after that is to work on porting the demo applications from
the Bullet distribution's "Demos" directory to Python, testing and fixing up
any required functionality along the way.  If anybody is interested in helping
with this, let me know!

== REQUIREMENTS ==

Note: Currently these bindings have only been developed/tested against Bullet
2.81/2.82.  Other versions of the Bullet library may or may not work, I haven't
tried it..

To build this package, you will need the following:

    * PyPy 2.2.x or later
    * Bullet libraries and include files (duh)
    * The same C++ compiler/linker used to build Bullet (C++ is picky about
      these things)
    * GNU Make
    * The 'patch' utility

Additionally, the following software specific to generating cppyy bindings is
also required:

    * Reflex (2013-08-14 or newer)
    * gccxml

For details on obtaining and installing Reflex/gccxml on your system, please see:

    http://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/cppyy.html

=== BUILDING/INSTALLING ===

TODO: This process will eventually be converted to use a setup.py script
instead, but for right now, GNU Make is currently needed to build/install this
package..

Note: It may be necessary to edit Config.mk and change the paths appropriately
for your system before building.

To build the bindings, simply type 'make' (or 'make all').  'make check' can
also be used to perform basic checks to make sure everything built correctly
and the cppyy library can be properly imported.

To install the bullet bindings for all PyPy programs, type 'make install' (or
'sudo make install', if necessary).  This will copy the necessary files to
PyPy's site-packages directory.

Alternately, if you want to use the bindings without installing them, you can
set the following environment variables instead:

  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<this directory>/cppyy
  export PYTHONPATH=<this directory>/python

=== USING ===

The recommended way to use these bindings from pypy, once they have been
properly built and installed, is as follows:

  from bullet import bt

Then all of the normal Bullet functions/constants/etc will be available under
the "bt" module, like so:

  broadphase = bt.DbvtBroadphase()

The goal is to make the bindings as transparent as possible, so you should be
able to use existing Bullet API documentation/samples/etc with only minor
(and obvious) changes in a Python program (for an example of this, see the
"wiki_helloworld.py" program in the "Demos" directory).

Note that under the "bt" module, the initial "bt" (if present) in Bullet's
class/function/etc names is stripped off, so for example "btDbvtBroadphase()"
in C++ becomes "bt.DbvtBroadphase()" in Python.  (Likewise, for constants,
"BT_NULL_PAIR" becomes "bt.NULL_PAIR", etc)

If you really want to, you can also refer to things with the "bt" or "BT_"
prefix intact (i.e. "bt.DbvtBroadphase()" and "bt.btDbvtBroadphase()" refer to
the same thing), but this is generally just redundant, so the shorter form is
recommended.  (And please don't mix multiple styles in the same program, as
that's just bound to confuse people..)

Note that some symbols are also available under the "bullet" module directly,
as well, and you could do "from bullet import *" instead, in which case you
would get a bunch the Bullet symbols (with their "bt"/"BT_" prefixes intact)
directly in your module's namespace (and you could then just refer to
"btDbvtBroadphase()" in your code).  PLEASE NOTE, however, that due to
limitations in the way Python modules work, global variables and constants
cannot be accessed this way.  You will still need to access them via 'bt' (or
'bullet.bt', depending on how you import things).  To reduce confusion (and to
keep the global namespace cleaner), it is recommended that you just use "from
bullet import bt" and "bt.<symbolname>" to reference everything instead.
